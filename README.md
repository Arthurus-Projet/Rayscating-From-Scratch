Wolfenstein 3D is a classic first-person shooter game released in 1992. Itâ€™s often considered one of the pioneers of the FPS genre. 

The game features pseudo-3D graphics, which create a 3D experience using 2D sprites and textures.

Raycasting estimates the distance of each ray. In other words, the distance between the player and the wall for a given ray. The higher the distance, the farther the wall will be. From each ray we draw a rectangle that will be more or less distant. And the sum of all these rectangles gives the illusion of 3D.
